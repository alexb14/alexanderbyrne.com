    At its heart, Unlock Melbourne is a way to discover more about a new city in just a tap. 
    With more than 200,000 international students studying in Victoria each year, 
    Unlock Melbourne is the best way for them to discover more about their new home.

<BodyText heading="Language üó£ and design üé®" eyebrow="The solution" accent="#6650CB">
We designed the Unlock Melbourne app around the universal language of emojis <span role="img" aria-label="sunglasses on a smiley face">üòé</span>. 
This allowed us to reach all students in an accessible, familiar and friendly way. 
<br></br><br></br>
Although the emoji's are different on each platform we shared the duplicate elements to create a consistent design between iOS and Android.

The tasks were designed to be easy, fun and friendly. Using big buttons and

<BodyText heading="Emoji's can simplify an experience" eyebrow="Learnings & Outcomes" accent="#6650CB">
Throughout this project I learnt the true power of the emoji and how it can  help an interface tell a better story. 
Although I came onboard after the planning and strategy had been done, 
I did my best to talk to the project team to catch up on as much knowledge and direction as possible. 
This was one of the funnest projects I've ever worked on it's purpose left me with a feeling of making a positive impact.

Unlock Melbourne launched in early 2018 in time for the new university year and sits at a 4.7‚òÖ rating on the Google Play Store.
