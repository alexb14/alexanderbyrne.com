    <IntroText heading="Unlock Melbourne">
    With more than 200,000 international students moving to Victoria each year, Unlock Melbourne is an app to guide them through 
    living and studying in their new home. At its heart, Unlock Melbourne is a way to discover more about a new city in just a tap.

      <BodyText heading="" eyebrow="The problem" accent="#6650CB">
      Study Melbourne, a Government initiative, came to the agency wanting to co-design a positive impact on the wellbeing of these students. 
      <br></br><br></br>
      Through the process, they learnt that the ability for these students to orient themselves, within weeks of arrival, has an enormous effect on their time in the state.
      <br></br><br></br> 
      We landed on the need to create a fun, habit-forming app that felt great to use, for an audience with English as a second language.
      </BodyText>

      <BodyText heading="" eyebrow="Key focus areas" accent="#6650CB">
      1. Design an experience that guides through the most important tasks to complete in their first days in Melbourne‚Äîfrom learning how to say ‚Äòhello‚Äô to finding out how to seek help. 
      <br></br><br></br>
      2. Ensure the tasks feel approachable and easy through natural language and satisfying interactions. 
      <br></br><br></br>
      3. Create a consistent mobile experience across iOS and Android.
      </BodyText>

      <BodyText heading="Spark excitement before they arrived" eyebrow="The solution" accent="#6650CB">
      We needed to provide students with essential introductory details and to find out key information eg. 
      landing date so the app could know when to begin interacting with the student. We saw these requirements 
      as an opportunity to also spark excitement earlier in the user journey via a pre-arrival onboarding experience.

<BodyText heading="Language üó£ and design üé®" eyebrow="The solution" accent="#6650CB">
We designed the Unlock Melbourne app around the universal language of emojis <span role="img" aria-label="sunglasses on a smiley face">üòé</span>. 
This allowed us to reach all students in an accessible, familiar and friendly way.
<br></br><br></br>
Although the emojis are different on each platform we shared all other design elements to create a consistent design between iOS and Android.

<BodyText heading="Emojis can simplify an experience" eyebrow="Learnings & Outcomes" accent="#6650CB">
Throughout this project I learnt the true power of a universal language and how it can help an interface tell a better story, 
especially with a user base this broad (hailing from over 170 different countries). 
This was one of the most enjoyable projects I've ever worked on as I was able to further my skills around interaction design and animation. 
It also felt great to hear of the positive impact it had on students going through what can be a tough transition.
<br></br><br></br>
Unlock Melbourne launched in time for the new university year in 2018 and currently sits at a 4.7‚òÖ rating on the Google Play Store.
